# CSMM Server Shop

## Overview

CSMM provides server owners the ability to operate a shop for players, allowing them to spend CSMM currency on whatever items the server owners specify. Each server's shop is unique, allowing you to add only the items you want, and set the prices to whatever you desire.

::: warning 
CSMM pulls the list of possible items directly from the server itself, so if your server includes modded or custom items, they will be available to add to the shop. However, if those custom items require custom graphics (such as items added in total conversion mod packs), those graphics may not be available to the shop.

## Setting up the Shop

1. In the CSMM web UI, expand your server on the nav-panel to the left, and click Settings.
1. Inside Settings, find the 'Economy' pane and expand it. Note that this is different from the Economy panel from the main server panel; that page hosts the server economy log files, not the configuration of the Economy itself.
1. Inside Economy, click the Shop button.
::: tip
The URL you are taken to is the shop URL for your server. This is the public page for your server shop; any player on your serer can access this page to buy from the shop, and anyone you've configured in CSMM with the 'Manage Economy' setting can edit the shop itself from this same page.
